/**
 * Berman lives in a rectangular grid. Each cell in the grid either contains a B or nothing at all.

Each B can be planted in any cell of the grid but once planted, it will detonate after exactly 3 seconds.
 Once a B detonates, it's destroyed â€” along with anything in its four neighboring cells. This means that if a 
 B detonates in cell , any valid cells  and  are cleared. If there is a B in a neighboring cell, the neighboring 
 B is destroyed without detonating, so there's no chain reaction.

Berman is immune to Bs, so he can move freely throughout the grid. Here's what he does:

Initially, Berman arbitrarily plants Bs in some of the cells, the initial state.
After one second, Berman does nothing.
After one more second, Berman plants Bs in all cells without Bs, thus filling the whole grid with Bs. 
No Bs detonate at this point.
After one more second, any Bs planted exactly three seconds ago will detonate. Here, Berman stands back and observes.
Berman then repeats steps 3 and 4 indefinitely.
Note that during every second Berman plants Bs, the Bs are planted simultaneously (i.e., at the exact same moment), 
and any Bs planted at the same time will detonate at the same time.

Given the initial configuration of the grid with the locations of Berman's first batch of planted Bs, 
determine the state of the grid after  seconds.
