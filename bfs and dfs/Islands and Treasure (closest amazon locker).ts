/**
 * You are given a ùëö √ó ùëõ m√ón 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:
 * 
 * -1 - A water cell that can not be traversed.
 * 0 - A treasure chest.
 * INF - A land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF.
 * Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. If a land cell cannot reach a treasure chest
 * than the value should remain INF.
 * 
 * Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [
 *   [2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],
 *   [2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],
 *   [2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],
 *   [0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]
 * ]
 * 
 * Output: [
 *   [3,-1,0,1],
 *   [2,2,1,-1],
 *   [1,-1,2,-1],
 *   [0,-1,3,4]
 * ]
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [
 *   [0,-1],
 *   [2147483647,2147483647]
 * ]
 * 
 * Output: [
 *   [0,-1],
 *   [1,2]
 * ]
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 100
 * grid[i][j] is one of {-1, 0, 2147483647}
